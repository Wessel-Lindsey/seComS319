The Koenigsegg One:1 was presented at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show held in March. Koenigsegg built six cars apart from the car presented at the Geneva Motor Show, all of which were already sold. Koenigsegg took two cars to the 2014 Goodwood Festival of Speed, where they were displayed alongside other sports cars such as the McLaren P1, LaFerrari, the Porsche 918 Spyder and the Pagani Huayra.
